/**
 * A 'Rule' in the segaWeb Portal is the bit of logic that dictates how an experiment behaves. 
 * For example an experiment that is to check soil moisture values and issue on/off commands might
 * only have a single rule that contains the logic to check certain channels and compare those values
 * to threshold values and subsequently issue commands if needed. The idea behind using this format
 * is that rules should be able to be turned on or off whenever an experimenter needs them to, but also
 * provides a way to write logic after the experiment is up and running and add it on the fly.
